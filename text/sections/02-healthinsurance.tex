    \textbf{Note:}
    This figure summarises the relevant results of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment \citep{finkelstein2008oregon}.
    The lottery results show that being randomly selected off the Medicaid wait-list increased health insurance rate by 19\%.
    The effect of health insurance shows estimates of the average complier effect of having health insurance on surveyed outcomes.
    It uses the wait-list lottery as an instrument for having health insurance, and the \cite{abadie2003semiparametric} weighting scheme to estimate the average complier levels, $\Egiven{Y_i(z',.)}{\text{lottery complier}}$ for each $z'=0,1$.

    \textbf{Note:}
    This figure summarises the pertinent results of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment \citep{finkelstein2008oregon}.
    The lottery results show that being randomly selected off the Medicaid wait-list increased health insurance rate by 19\%.
    The effect of health insurance shows estimates of the avaerage complier effect, using the lottery as an instrument for having health insurance and the \cite{abadie2003semiparametric} weighting scheme to estimate the average complier levels $\E{Y_i(., d')}{\text{lottery complier}}$ for $d'=0,1$.

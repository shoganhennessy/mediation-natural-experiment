\section{Direct and Indirect Effects}
\label{sec:mediation}
Causal mediation decomposes causal effects into two channels, through a mediator (indirect effect) and through all other paths (direct effect).
To develop notation for direct and indirect effects, write $Z_i$ for an exogenous binary treatment, $D_i$ a binary mediator, and $Y_i$ an outcome for individuals $i = 1, \hdots, n$.\footnote{
    Other literatures use different notation.
    For example, \cite{imai2010identification} write $T_i, M_i, Y_i$ for the randomised treatment, mediator, and outcome, respectively.
    I use $Z_i, D_i, Y_i$ to stick to the instrumental variables notation \cite{angrist1996identification}, more familiar in empirical economics \citep{angrist2009mostly}. 
}
The outcomes are a sum of their potential outcomes.\footnote{
    This paper exclusively focuses on the binary case.
    See \cite{huber2020direct} for a discussion of CM with continuous treatment and/or mediator, and the assumptions required.
}
\begin{align*}
    D_i &= Z_i       D_i(1)
        + (1 - Z_i) D_i(0),  \\
    Y_i &= Z_i       Y_i(1, D_i(1))
        + (1 - Z_i) Y_i(0, D_i(0)).
\end{align*}

%Write $\vec X_i$ for a set of control variables, and assume $Z_i$ is ignorable --- possibly conditional on $\vec X_i$.
Assume $Z_i$ is ignorable.\footnote{
    This assumption can hold conditional on covariates.
    To simplify notation in this section, leave the conditional part unsaid, as it changes no part of the identification framework.
}
\[ Z_i \indep  D_i(z), Y_i(z', d), \textnormal{ for } z, z', d = 0, 1 \]

There are only two average effects which are identified (without additional assumptions).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The average first-stage refers to the effect of the treatment on mediator, $Z \to D$.
    \[ \Egiven{D_i}{Z_i = 1} - \Egiven{D_i}{Z_i = 0}
        = \E{D_i(1) - D_i(0)} \]
    It common in the economics literature to assume that $Z$ influences $D$ in at most one direction, $\Prob{D_i(1) \geq D_i(0)} = 1$ --- monotonicity \citep{imbens1994identification}.
    I assume monotonicity (and its conditional variant) holds through-out to simplify notation.\footnote{
        Assuming monotonicity also brings closer to the IV notation, and has other beneficial implications in this setting (see \autoref{sec:controlfun}).
    }
    \item The reduced-form effect refers to the effect of the treatment on outcome, $Z \to Y$, and is also known as the intent-to-treat effect in experimental settings, or total effect in causal mediation literature.
    \[ \Egiven{Y_i}{Z_i = 1} - \Egiven{Y_i}{Z_i = 0}
        = \E{Y_i(1, D_i(1)) - Y_i(0, D_i(0))} \]
\end{enumerate}
In this setting, $Z_i$ affects outcome $Y_i$ directly, and indirectly via the $D_i(Z_i)$ channel, with no reverse causality.
% The framework is general to any (conditionally) randomly assigned $Z_i$, intermiedate mediator $D_i$, and outcome $Y_i$.
%This section focuses on binary $Z_i, D_i = 0,1$, and not the continuous versions, to simplify the causal framework.%\footnote{
    %\autoref{appendix:continuous} relates the causal framework to continuous $Z_i,D_i$, which has little conceptual differences.}
\autoref{fig:scm-model} visualises the design, where the direction arrows denote the causal direction (and no reverse causality).
On the other hand, mediation aims to decompose the reduced form effect of $Z \to Y$ into these two separate pathways.
\begin{align*}
    \text{Average Indirect Effect (AIE), } D(Z) \to Y: \;\;\;&
        \E{Y_i(Z_i, D_i(1)) - Y_i(Z_i, D_i(0))} \\
    \text{Average Direct Effect (ADE), } Z \to Y: \;\;\;&
        \E{Y_i(1, D_i(Z_i)) - Y_i(0, D_i(Z_i))}
\end{align*}
These effects are not separately identified without further assumptions.

\subsection{Identifying Causal Mediation (CM) Effects}
The conventional approach to estimating direct and indirect effects assumes both $Z_i$ and $D_i$ are ignorable, conditional on a set of control variables $\vec X_i$.
\begin{definition}
    \label{dfn:seq-ign}
    Sequential Ignorability \citep{imai2010identification}.
    \begin{align}
        \label{eqn:seq-ign-Z}
        Z_i \indep  D_i(z), Y_i(z', d) \;\; &| \;\; \vec X_i,
            &\textnormal{ for } z, z', d = 0, 1 \\
        \label{eqn:seq-ign-D}
        D_i \indep  Y_i(z', d) \;\; &| \;\; \vec X_i, Z_i = z', 
            &\textnormal{ for } z', d = 0, 1
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
Sequential ignorability assumes that the initial treatment $Z_i$ is assigned randomly, conditional on $\vec X_i$.
It then also assumes that, after $Z_i$ is assigned, that $D_i$ is assigned randomly conditional $\vec X_i, Z_i$.
If sequential ignorability, \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-Z} and \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-D}, holds then the direct and indirect effects are identified by two-stage mean differences, after conditioning on $\vec X_i$.\footnote{
    \cite{imai2010identification} show a general identification statement; I show identification in terms of two-stage regression, which is more familiar in economics.
    This reasoning is in line with G-computation reasoning \citep{robins1986g};
    \autoref{appendix:identification} states the \cite{imai2010identification} identification result, and then develops the two-stage regression notation which holds as a consequence of sequential ignorability.

\[ = \underbrace{\E{Y_i(Z_i, D_i(1)) - Y_i(Z_i, D_i(0))}}_{\text{Average Indirect Effect (AIE)}} \]
}}
I refer to the estimands on the left-hand side as Causal Mediation (CM) estimands.
These estimands are typically estimated with linear models, with resulting estimates composed from OLS estimates \citep{imai2010identification}.
%\begin{align*}
%    D_i &= \phi + \pi Z_i
%        + \vec \psi_1' \vec X_i+ \eta_i \\
%    Y_i &= \alpha + \beta D_i + \gamma Z_i + \delta Z_i D_i
%        + \vec \psi_2' \vec X_i + \varepsilon_i
%\end{align*}
%And so the CM estimands are composed from OLS estimates,
%$\hat \gamma + \hat\delta \E{D_i}$ for the Average Direct Effect (ADE) and
%$\hat\pi \left(\hat \beta + \E{Z_i} \hat \delta \right)$ for the average indirect effect (AIE).
While this is the most common approach in the applied literature, I do not assume the linear model.
% of this problem as it assumes homogenous treatment effects and linear confounding.
Linearity assumptions are unnecessary to my analysis; it suffices to note that heterogeneous treatment effects and non-linear confounding would bias OLS estimates of CM estimands in the same manner that is well documented elsewhere (see e.g., \citealt{angrist1998estimating,sloczynski2022interpreting}).
This section focuses on problems that plague CM in practice, regardless of estimation method.
% As such, I focus my work on non-parametric identification, and employ semi- and non-parametric estimation methods in my empirical analysis  whenever possible to avoid these problems.

\subsection{Bias in Causal Mediation Estimates}
Applied research may use a natural experiment to justify the treatment $Z_i$ is ignorable, justifying assumption \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-Z}.
Rarely does research relying on a quasi-experimental research design employ an additional, overlapping identification design for $D_i$ to justify assumption \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-D} as part of the analysis.
One might consider using conventional CM methods to estimate direct and indirect effects, and learn about the mechanisms behind the treatment effect under study.%\footnote{
%    \cite{imai2013experimental} call attention to the need for a separate research design to isolate causal effects of $D_i$ in randomised controlled trials; \autoref{appendix:mediation-review} overviews literature, finding many papers that employ mediation methods with a research design for $Z_i$, but not for $D_i$.
%}
This approach leads to biased estimates, and contaminates inference regarding direct and indirect effects. %(in the same manner as \citealt{heckman1998characterizing}).

\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:selection-bias}
    Absent an identification strategy for the mediator, causal mediation estimates are at risk of selection bias.
    Suppose \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-Z} holds, but \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-D} does not.
    Then CM estimands are contaminated by selection bias and group difference terms.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    See \autoref{appendix:mediation-bias} for the extended proof.
\end{proof}
Below I present the relevant selection bias and group difference terms, omitting the conditional on $\vec X_i$ notation for brevity.

        \end{aligned} \right)

\end{align*}

The selection bias terms come from systematic differences between the treated and untreated groups, differences not fully unexplained by $\vec X_i$.
These selection bias terms would equal to zero if the mediator was ignorable \ref{dfn:seq-ign}\eqref{eqn:seq-ign-D}, but do not necessarily average to zero if not.
The group differences represent the fact that a matching estimator gives an average effect on the treated group and, when selection-on-observables does not hold, this is systematically different from the average effect \citep{heckman1998characterizing}.\footnote{
    The group differences term is longer for the AIE estimate, because the indirect effect is comprised from the effect of $D_i$ local to $Z_i$ compliers; a matching estimator gets the average effect on treated, and the longer term adjusts for differences with the complier average effect.
}$^{,}$\footnote{
    The selection-on-observables approach could, instead, focus on the average effect on treated populations (as do \citealt{keele2015identifying}).
    This runs into a problem of comparisons: CM estimates would give average effects on different treated groups.
    The CM estimand for the ADE on treated gives the ADE local to the $Z_i = 1$ treated group, and local to the $D_i = 1$ group for the AIE.
    In this way, these ADE and AIE on treated terms are not comparable to each other, so I focus on the true averages to avoid these misaligned comparisons.
}
The group differences term is a non-parametric framing of the bias from controlling for intermediate outcomes, previously studied only in a linear setting.
This is referred to as ``bad controls'' by \cite{cinelli2024crash}, or M-bias by \cite{ding2015adjust}.

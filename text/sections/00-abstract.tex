Natural experiments are a cornerstone of applied economics, providing settings for estimating causal effects with a compelling argument for treatment ignorability.
Applied researchers often investigate mechanisms behind treatment effects by controlling for a mediator of interest, alluding to Causal Mediation (CM) methods for estimating direct and indirect effects (CM effects).
This approach to investigating mechanisms unintentionally assumes the mediator is quasi-randomly assigned --- in addition to the quasi-random assignment of the initial treatment.
Individuals' choice to take (or refuse) a mediator based on costs and benefits is inconsistent with mediator ignorability, suggesting in-practice estimates of CM effects are biased in natural experiment settings.
I solve for explicit bias terms when the mediator is not ignorable, imitating classical selection bias for average causal effects.
I consider an alternative approach to credibly estimate CM effects, when selection-into-mediator is driven by unobserved costs and benefits.
The approach uses a control function adjustment, relying on mediator take-up cost as an instrument.
Simulations confirm that this method corrects for selection bias in conventional CM estimates, providing both parametric and semi-parametric methods.
% I illustrate the approach by estimating the proportion of the causal effect of genes associated with education that operates via higher education decisions versus a direct genetic channel.
% Finally, I provide an implementation of this method in the \textit{R} package \textit{mediate-selection}, offering an accessible tool to investigate mechanisms in natural experiment settings.
This approach gives applied researchers an alternative method to estimate CM effects when they can only establish a credible argument for quasi-random assignment of the initial treatment, and not a mediator, as is common in natural experiments.

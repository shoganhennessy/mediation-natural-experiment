%\textbf{Hook:}
Economists use natural experiments to credibly answer social questions, when an experiment was infeasible.
For example, does winning access to health insurance causally improve health and well-being \citep{finkelstein2008oregon}?
Natural experiments are settings which answer these questions, but give little indication of how these effects came about.
Causal Mediation (CM) aims to estimate the mechanisms behind causal effects, by estimating how much of the treatment effect operates through a proposed mediator mechanism.
For example, do causal gains from winning access to health insurance come mostly from physical use of healthcare, or plausible psychological gains from no longer having to worry about being uninsured?
This study of mechanisms behind causal effects broadens the economic understanding of social settings studied with natural experiments.
This paper shows that the conventional approach to estimating CM effects is inappropriate in a natural experiment setting, provides a theoretical framework for how bias operates, and develops an approach to correctly estimate CM effects under alternative assumptions.
These methods contrast the current practice in applied economics of providing suggestive evidence of mechanisms, which gives necessary but not sufficient conditions for the mechanisms behind a treatment effect.

% Paragraph here: how do applied economists currently do it?

%\textbf{Question:}
This paper starts by considering conventional CM methods in a natural experiment setting.
Conventional CM methods rely on assuming the initial treatment, and the subsequent mediator mechanism, are both quasi-randomly assigned \citep{imai2010identification}.
Assuming the mediator is as-good-as-randomly assigned requires either (1) selection is fully captured by observabed control variables, or (2) that decisions are effectively random.
The assumption can be plausible when a researcher has access to a very rich set of control variables, or mediator is directly manipulated.
In economic applications, however, unconstrained take-up reflects choices based on costs and benefits, which complicates the argument for mediator quasi-random assignment.
For example, winners of the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment wait-list were randomly chosen by a lottery, but made the choice to visit healthcare possibly factoring the effects of undiagnosed health conditions (unobserved by the researcher).
In practice, the main observational setting where mediator quasi-random assignment becomes credible is when another natural experiment affected the mediator --- a rare occurrence given how difficult it is to find one source of random variation for a treatment, let alone another independent source for a mediator, at the same time.

%\textbf{Antecedents:}
Applied economics research often complements reduced-form causal estimates with suggestive evidence for mechanisms behind the treatment effect.
These descriptive analyses are informative, but do not generally identify a mediating pathway without additional assumptions --- see also \citet{blackwell2024assumption,green2010enough}.
A new strand of the econometric literature has arisen in implicit acknowledgement that suggestive evidence of mechanisms, or a conventional approach to CM, can lead to biased inference and needs alternative methods for credible inference.
These include identifying CM effects with overlapping quasi-experimental research designs \citep{deuchert2019direct,frolich2017direct}, functional form restrictions \citep{heckman2015econometric,heckman2013understanding}, partial identification \citep{flores2009identification}, or a hypothesis test of full mediation through observed channels \citep{kwon2024testing} --- see \cite{huber2019review} for an overview.\footnote{
    An alternative method to estimate CM effects is ensuring treatment and mediator quasi-random assignment holds by a running two randomised controlled trials for both treatment and mediator, at the same time.
    This set-up has been considered in the literature previously, in theory \citep{imai2013experimental} and in practice \citep{ludwig2011mechanism}.
}

%\textbf{Value-added:}
I develop a framework showing exactly how selection bias contaminates conventional CM estimates when mediator choices are driven by unobserved gains --- settings where none of the natural experiment research designs in the previously cited papers apply (i.e., the mediator is not ignorable).
This provides a rigorous warning to applied economists against uncritically applying conventional CM methods to investigate mechanisms --- as is common in the fields of epidemiology, psychology, and medicine.

Selection based on costs and benefits is at odds with assuming a mediator is as-good-as randomly assigned in an observational setting, so I import methods grounded in labour economic theory to solve the identification problem.
This approach identifies CM effects via the marginal effect of the mediator, and requires three main assumptions.
(1) Mediator take-up must respond only positively to the initial treatment (monotonicity), which implies mediator selection follows a selection model.
(2) Mediator take-up is motivated by mediator benefits.
(3) A valid instrument for mediator take-up must exist, to avoid relying on parametric assumptions on unobserved selection.
While these assumptions are strong, they are plausible in many applied settings.
Mediator monotonicity aligns with conventional theories for selection-into-treatment, and is accepted widely in many applications using an instrumental variables research design.
Selection based on costs and benefits is central to economic theory, and is the dominant concern for judging observational designs that identify causal effects.
Access to valid instrumental variation is a strong condition, though is important to avoid further modelling assumptions; the most compelling example is using variation in mediator take-up costs as an instrument.

Applying the new methods to the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment shows that unobserved selection matters in an analysis of a real-world natural experiment.
A substantial portion of the wait-list lottery's impact on subjective health and well-being is mediated indirectly through extra healthcare usage, after instrumenting for healthcare usage with respondents' usual provider.
A conventional CM analysis would put this indirect mediated share at practically zero, so that my methods expose that negative selection into healthcare usage would be hiding evidence for this mechanism.
These estimates replace claims on mechanisms with credible causal evidence that extra healthcare use mediates a sizeable share of the Medicaid-lottery's benefits, avoiding claims based only on suggestive conjecture.

The methods I propose for CM analyses are not perfect for every setting: the structural assumptions are strong, and are tailored to selection-into-mediator based on the economic principle of selection based on costs and benefits.
Indeed, this approach provides no safe harbour for estimating CM effects if these structural assumptions do not hold true.
This approach imports insights from the instrumental variables literature, connecting the influential \cite{imai2010identification} approach to CM with the economics literature on selection-into-treatment and marginal treatment effects \citep{vytlacil2002independence,heckman2004using,heckman2005structural,florens2008identification,kline2019heckits}.

\cite{frolich2017direct} have previously explored identification of CM effects with a control function in the context of two instruments (one each for treatment and mediator) and a continuous mediator.
This paper considers CM effects via the marginal effect of a binary mediator, with a different identification analysis and estimation strategies.

\autoref{sec:applied} describes this bias in applied settings with (1) a regression framework, (2) a setting with selection based on costs and benefits.
\autoref{sec:selectionmodel} purges bias from CM estimates by identifying CM effects with a control function adjustment, via the marginal effect of the mediator.
\autoref{sec:controlfun} demonstrates how to estimate CM effects with this approach, with either parametric or semi-parametric methods, and gives simulation evidence.

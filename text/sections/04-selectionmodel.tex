\section{Solving Identification with a Selection Model}
\label{sec:selectionmodel}
If your goal is to estimate CM effects, and you could control for unobserved selection terms $U_{0,i}, U_{1,i}$, then you would.
This ideal example would yield unbiased estimates.
% Alas, $U_i$ is by definition unobserved.
The selection model takes this insight seriously, providing conditions to model the implied unobserved confounding by $U_{0,i}, U_{1,i}$, and then control for it.

Writing here about how a \cite{heckman1974shadow} selection model purges selection bias.

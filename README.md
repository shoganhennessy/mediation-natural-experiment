## Explanation

This folder contains all relevant files for my academic project ``Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments.''

## Current plan and to-dos.

1. Fix writing with ``implied behaviour'' writing.

2. Adjust estimation procedure to have different estimation for direct and indirect effects.
The indirect effect should be weighted towards compliers.

3. Writing comments from Hyewon.

- Section 1.0 + 1.1
1. Is Average Direct Effect as "violation of exclusion restriction"? It might be worth referring to usual labor economics term to bring labor audience along.
2. Why does ADE still exist under ignorable assumption? Doesn't your independence assumption (=ignorable assumption) rule out exclusion restriction?
3. Is AIE + ADE = Total, i.e, Reduced Form Effect?
4. Does Sequential Ignorability same as assuming that "complier status" is being randomly assigned? Then it may have testable implication.
5. Are we interested in AIE/ADE averaged across all population? Can we get at AIE/ADE for a subpopulation with less strong assumption, like LATE.
6. Might be helpful to show linearity assumption vs relaxing it in later applied case
7. Is ADE (AIE) + group differences sort of LATE version of ADE (AIE)?
8 . If mediator is ignorable, are you already ruling out roy style?
Roy: Y(1) - Y(0) (or U1-U0) being correlated with D

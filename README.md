## Explanation

This folder contains all relevant files for my academic project ``Causal Mediation in Natural Experiments.''

## Current plan and to-dos.

1. Re-write the section 3, starting with assuming D_i follows a Roy model
``3. Causal Mediation Under Selection.''

- Show implied behaviour if one assumes seq ig under a ROy model.

- Leads to a clear statement of ''seq ig'' implies ''THIS,'' where ''THIS'' is a mathematical statement with some clear BS going on.
A clear economic example of how it would be unrealistic.

- One clear way to do this would be to develop a testable implication, and show this implication is rejected.

2. Look into using the notation of choosing D_i where E_I[ Y(., D) - cost(D)] > 0 is maximised over an information set I.

- Information set I does some heavy lifting for now, as it gives an idea of how individuals could select into D --- and how the ignorability assumption came about.
- Alternatively, I could not use the I notation at all, and keep it for another project pontificating about the Roy model as a judge of conditional ignorability assumption, ``Selection into Treatment: Principled Judgments of Independence Assumptions in Observational Economic Research.''

3. New section for the control function solution.

- Show the regression framework in here, and assume monotonicity + correlated error terms.
- Come to an identification statement, and note this is for the average effects (not compliers, see Walters etc.).
- Show simulation evidence, look at another paper for how to set up this simulation evidence.
- Sensitivity analysis for correlated error terms, the main (questionable) model-based assumption that powers this analysis.
